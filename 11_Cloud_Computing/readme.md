# **🗓️ Day 61: Introduction to Cloud Computing**  

### **🔹 What is Cloud Computing?**  
Cloud computing refers to the **on-demand availability of computing resources** (servers, storage, databases, networking, software, etc.) over the internet, eliminating the need for local hardware.

### **🔹 Characteristics of Cloud Computing**  
✅ **On-Demand Self-Service** – Users can provision resources as needed.  
✅ **Broad Network Access** – Services are accessible over the internet.  
✅ **Resource Pooling** – Providers share resources among multiple users.  
✅ **Rapid Elasticity** – Resources can scale up/down automatically.  
✅ **Measured Service** – Pay only for what you use.

### **🔹 Cloud Computing Service Models**  
| **Model** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** | Provides virtualized computing resources like VMs, storage, networking | AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs |
| **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** | Provides a development platform with tools to build applications | AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Azure App Services |
| **SaaS (Software as a Service)** | Delivers software over the internet, managed by the provider | Gmail, Dropbox, Microsoft 365 |

### **🔹 Deployment Models of Cloud Computing**  
| **Deployment Model** | **Description** |
|----------------------|---------------|
| **Public Cloud** | Resources are shared among multiple users (AWS, Azure, GCP) |
| **Private Cloud** | Dedicated cloud infrastructure for a single organization |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | A combination of public and private clouds |

### **🔹 Why Use Cloud Computing?**  
✅ **Cost-effective** – No need for expensive hardware.  
✅ **Scalability** – Easily increase/decrease resources.  
✅ **Security & Reliability** – Managed security and redundancy.
