# Introduction to DevOps

## What is DevOps?
DevOps is a combination of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) aimed at automating and improving software delivery and infrastructure management. It promotes collaboration, automation, continuous integration, and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to enhance software quality, reduce time to market, and improve reliability.

## Why DevOps?
Before DevOps, software development followed the traditional waterfall or siloed model, where developers wrote code and handed it off to IT operations for deployment. This approach led to:
❌ Slow software releases
❌ Miscommunication between teams
❌ Manual, error-prone deployments
❌ High failure rates

## DevOps solves these issues by enabling:
✅ Faster software delivery
✅ Continuous feedback loops
✅ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for automation
✅ Monitoring and security integration

## Key Principles of DevOps
Collaboration & Communication – Breaking silos between dev, ops, and security teams
Automation – Automating code integration, testing, deployment, and infrastructure
Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) – Frequent and reliable releases
Monitoring & Feedback – Observability to detect and fix issues quickly
Security as Code – Integrating security into every stage (DevSecOps)
## DevOps Lifecycle
1️⃣ Plan – Define requirements, architecture, and goals
2️⃣ Develop – Write and manage code efficiently
3️⃣ Build – Compile and package the software
4️⃣ Test – Automate testing for quality assurance
5️⃣ Release – Prepare software for deployment
6️⃣ Deploy – Automated release pipelines
7️⃣ Operate – Infrastructure management, scaling, monitoring
8️⃣ Monitor – Observability, logging, and analytics

## DevOps Toolchain
DevOps relies on various tools for automation. Some popular tools include:

## Version Control → Git, GitHub, GitLab
CI/CD → Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI
Configuration Management → Ansible, Puppet, Chef
Containerization → Docker
Orchestration → Kubernetes
Cloud Platforms → AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
Monitoring & Logging → Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## DevOps Benefits
✅ Faster software releases
✅ Improved collaboration & efficiency
✅ Reduced failures & downtime
✅ Better security & compliance
✅ Scalability with cloud-native solutions
