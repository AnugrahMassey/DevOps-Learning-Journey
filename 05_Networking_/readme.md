## ✅ **Day 21: Introduction to Networking**

### 📌 **What is Networking?**
- Networking refers to the interconnection of multiple devices for data exchange.
- It allows computers to share resources and communicate using established protocols.

### 📚 **Types of Networks:**
1. **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Limited to a small geographical area like an office.
2. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Connects networks over large areas, like the internet.
3. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Covers a city or campus.

### 📡 **Essential Networking Components:**
- **Router:** Connects different networks.
- **Switch:** Connects devices within a network.
- **Firewall:** Ensures network security.
- **DNS Server:** Resolves domain names to IP addresses.

### 🧑‍💻 **Basic Networking Commands:**
- `ifconfig` or `ip a` - Display network interfaces and IP addresses.
- `ping <IP>` - Test connectivity to a device.
- `traceroute <IP>` - Trace the path packets take to reach a host.
- `nslookup <domain>` - Get IP from a domain.
- `curl <URL>` - Send HTTP requests to a server.
