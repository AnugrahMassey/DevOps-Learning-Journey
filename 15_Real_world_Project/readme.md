## ✅ **Week 16: Real-World Project Deployment (Days 81–85)**

🎯 *Goal: Set up a full CI/CD pipeline on cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, or Azure).*

---

### 🔹 **Day 81: Introduction to CI/CD Pipeline in the Cloud**

#### 🔧 Key Concepts:

* **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates the process of code integration, testing, and deployment.
* **CI** (Continuous Integration): Developers push code regularly; automated tests are run.
* **CD** (Continuous Deployment/Delivery): Code changes are automatically deployed to production or staging.

#### 💡 Common Tools:

* **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI
* **Cloud Providers**: AWS (CodePipeline), GCP (Cloud Build), Azure (DevOps)
* **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS)
* **Image Registry**: DockerHub or cloud-specific registry

#### 🛠️ Tasks:

* Understand basic pipeline flow: `Code → Build → Test → Deploy`
* Learn how secrets and environment variables are managed in cloud pipelines.
* Explore real-world CI/CD example architectures.

### 🔹 **Day 82: Preparing the Application for Deployment**

#### 🧱 Key Steps:

* Ensure your app is containerized (Docker).
* Push your code to a GitHub/GitLab repository.
* Create `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore`.
* Create a sample Kubernetes manifest (`deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`).

#### 🧪 Checklist:

* ✅ Dockerized app (with Dockerfile)
* ✅ Code stored in version control
* ✅ Kubernetes manifests created
* ✅ CI config file initialized (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

#### 🛠️ Tasks:

* Write Dockerfile (multi-stage if possible)
* Test locally with `docker build` and `docker run`
* Push your image to a registry (e.g., DockerHub)

---

### 🔹 **Day 83: Automating the CI Process**

#### ⚙️ What to automate:

* Linting the code
* Running unit/integration tests
* Building Docker images

#### 🧰 Example (GitHub Actions):

```yaml
name: CI Workflow
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Docker
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
    - name: Build Docker image
      run: docker build -t your-image-name .
```

#### 🛠️ Tasks:

* Set up GitHub Actions for your app
* Automate image builds and push to DockerHub or AWS ECR/GCR
* Trigger pipeline on `git push`
