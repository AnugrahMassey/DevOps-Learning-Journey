## **📌 Week 3: Bash Scripting (Day 15-20)**
This week, we focused on **Bash scripting**, an essential skill for automating tasks in **DevOps**. Bash scripts help execute multiple commands in a sequence, making it easier to manage servers, automate deployments, and monitor system performance.

---

## **🔹 Day 15: Introduction to Bash Scripting**

### **What is Bash?**
- Bash (**Bourne Again Shell**) is a command-line interpreter used in **Linux**.
- A **Bash script** is a file that contains a set of commands executed in sequence.
- Scripts **automate** repetitive tasks such as file management, system monitoring, and deployment.

### **Why Use Bash Scripting in DevOps?**
✅ Automate server tasks  
✅ Schedule maintenance jobs  
✅ Manage user permissions and logs  
✅ Monitor system performance  

### **Creating Your First Bash Script**
1️⃣ Open a terminal and create a new file:
   ```bash
   nano hello.sh
   ```
2️⃣ Add the following code:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello, DevOps Engineer!"
   ```
3️⃣ Save and exit (`CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and press **Enter**).
4️⃣ Give execution permission:
   ```bash
   chmod +x hello.sh
   ```
5️⃣ Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./hello.sh
   ```
💡 **Explanation:**
- `#!/bin/bash` → Shebang, specifies that Bash should run the script.
- `echo` → Prints output to the terminal.
- `chmod +x` → Makes the script executable.

## **🔹 Day 16: Variables & User Input**

### **What Are Variables?**
A **variable** stores data that can be used later in the script.

#### **Declaring and Using Variables**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
name="DevOps Engineer"
echo "Welcome, $name!"
```
💡 **Explanation:**
- `name="DevOps Engineer"` → Assigns a value to `name`.
- `$name` → Retrieves and prints the variable value.

### **Taking User Input**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter your name: " username
echo "Hello, $username!"
```
💡 **Explanation:**
- `read -p "Message" variable` → Prompts user for input.
- `$username` → Stores and prints user input.

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
echo "Home Directory: $HOME"
echo "Current Directory: $PWD"
echo "Shell Used: $SHELL"
```
💡 **Common Environment Variables:**
- `$HOME` → User’s home directory.
- `$PWD` → Current working directory.
- `$SHELL` → Shell type in use.

## **🔹 Day 17: Conditional Statements & Loops**

### **If-Else Conditions**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a number: " num

if [ $num -gt 10 ]; then
   echo "Number is greater than 10"
else
   echo "Number is 10 or less"
fi
```
💡 **Explanation:**
- `if [ condition ]; then` → Checks a condition.
- `-gt` (greater than), `-lt` (less than), `-eq` (equal to).

### **Loops in Bash**
#### **For Loop**
```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
   echo "Iteration $i"
done
```
#### **While Loop**
```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
   echo "Count: $count"
   ((count++))
done
```
#### **Until Loop**
```bash
num=1
until [ $num -ge 5 ]; do
   echo "Number: $num"
   ((num++))
done
```
💡 **Explanation:**
- `for` loop → Runs a set number of times.
- `while` loop → Runs as long as condition is **true**.
- `until` loop → Runs **until** condition becomes **true**.

---

## **🔹 Day 18: Functions & Error Handling**

### **Creating a Function**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
greet() {
   echo "Hello, $1!"
}

greet "DevOps Engineer"
```
💡 **Explanation:**
- `greet()` → Defines a function.
- `$1` → First argument passed to the function.

### **Error Handling with `trap`**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
trap 'echo "Error on line $LINENO"; exit 1' ERR

ls /non_existent_directory
```
💡 **Explanation:**
- `trap` → Detects errors and runs a command.
- `$LINENO` → Shows line number of error.

---

## **🔹 Day 19: File & Process Management**

### **Checking If a File Exists**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
file="/var/log/syslog"

if [ -f "$file" ]; then
   echo "$file exists"
else
   echo "$file does not exist"
fi
```

### **Automating Log Cleanup (`cleanup_logs.sh`)**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
find /var/log -name "*.log" -type f -mtime +7 -exec rm -f {} \;
echo "Old log files deleted"
```
💡 **Explanation:**
- `find` → Searches files.
- `-mtime +7` → Deletes files older than 7 days.

### **Managing Processes (`process_manager.sh`)**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
ps aux | grep apache2
```
💡 **Explanation:**
- `ps aux` → Lists running processes.
- `grep apache2` → Filters processes by name.

---

## **🔹 Day 20: Automating with Cron Jobs & Logging**

### **Setting Up a Cron Job (`cron_scheduler.sh`)**
1️⃣ Open crontab:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
2️⃣ Add a cron job to clean logs every midnight:
   ```bash
   0 0 * * * /path/to/cleanup_logs.sh
   ```

### **Logging Script Execution (`logging.sh`)**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
LOGFILE="script.log"

log() {
   echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $1" | tee -a "$LOGFILE"
}

log "Script started"
sleep 2
log "Task completed"
```
💡 **Explanation:**
- `log()` → Function to log messages.
- `date` → Captures current timestamp.
- `tee -a` → Appends output to the log file.
